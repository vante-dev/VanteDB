VanteDB is a lightweight Node.js database library that simplifies basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on JSON files. It's designed to be easy to use and suitable for small to medium-sized projects where a full-fledged database system might be overkill

## Features

* **Simple Setup:** Get started quickly with minimal configuration.
* **JSON Storage:** Store data in JSON files for easy readability and management.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Perform database operations asynchronously using Promises.
* **Filter and Update:** Easily filter and update records in your collections.

## Installation

You can install VanteDB via npm:
```bash
npm install vantedb
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use VanteDB:
```js
const { Database } = require("vantedb");

// Initialize the database with the 'Json' type and a folder location
const db = new Database("Json", {
    Folder: 'Example/VanteDB'
});

const guildID = "your_guild_id";

(async () => {
    // Create multiple user records
    await db.create(guildID, "users", [
        { id: 1, name: "Vante" },
        { id: 2, name: "Kaan" },
        { id: 3, name: "Karahanli" },
        { id: 4, name: "Ertusmom" },
    ]);
    console.log("Created user records.");

    // Read all user records
    const users = await db.read(guildID, "users");
    console.log("All users:", users);

    // Update multiple user records where the name is "Vante" to "Kaan"
    await db.updateMany(guildID, "users", (user) => user.name === "Vante", { name: "Kaan" });
    console.log("Updated user records with name 'Vante' to 'Kaan'.");

    // Read all user records after the update
    const updatedUsers = await db.read(guildID, "users");
    console.log("Updated users:", updatedUsers);

    // Delete multiple user records where the name is "Kaan"
    await db.deleteMany(guildID, "users", (user) => user.name === "Kaan");
    console.log("Deleted user records with name 'Kaan'.");

    // Read all user records after the deletion
    const remainingUsers = await db.read(guildID, "users");
    console.log("Remaining users:", remainingUsers);
})();
```
